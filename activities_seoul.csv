Seoul Forest,"Introduction
Opened on June 18, 2005, Seoul Forest had previously undergone a series of changes on Ttukseom (Ttuk Island). In the past, the forest had been a royal hunting ground for kings and served as a military inspection facility. However, in more recent decades, the area has served a wide variety of functions. Ttukseom initially served as a water-treatment facility, and later as a golf course, horse racing track, and eventually a sports park.

Consisting of five parks spread over 180,000 pyeong (approximately 595,000 ㎡) of land, Seoul Forest is an eco-friendly zone appreciated not only by the people of the city but also those visiting Seoul. Seoul Forest is rapidly developing into the premium city-park of Korea like Hyde Park in London and Central Park in New York.

* Culture and Arts Park (220,000㎡)
Situated in the heart of Seoul Forest, the Cultural Art Park features Seoul Forest Square, Ttukseom Family Field, decorative flower beds, a visitor's center, a skate park, an outdoor stage, a waterside lounge (restaurant), an in-forest open space, an in-forest play ground and a water play area.

* Eco Forest (165,000㎡)
The Ecological Forest, once an area covered by the Hangang River, has been transformed into an eco-forest connecting the Han and Jungnang-cheon (Jungnang stream). This natural habitat for wildlife animals is home to fallow deer, formosan deer, elks, chipmunks, mandarin ducks, mallards, spot-billed ducks and moorhens. There is also an observatory to help visitors get a better view of the local wildlife.

* Experiential Learning Park (85,000㎡)
Occupying the structure of the former Ttukseom Water Treatment Facility, this refurbished educational area was established to house an insect botanical garden, a wild flower garden, a themed flower garden, an event ground and a surrounding protective forest.

* Marsh Plants Garden (70,000㎡)
Making use of the local reservoir’s natural environment, the Wetlands Ecological Field contains a wetlands ecological management office, an ecological playground, an outdoor nature classroom, a bird observatory, a wetlands flower garden and a botanical garden fed with local, clear waters.

* Hangang Riverside Park (33,000㎡)
Located southwest of Seoul Forest, this riverside area at the junction of the Hangang River and Jungnang-cheon features a waterfront park, a marina and a rest area.","273 Ttukseom-ro, Seongsu-dong 1(il)-ga, Seongdong-gu, Seoul, South Korea",https://scontent-cdg2-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/0b4e8c5aab40139381603b2c07e4299f/5E0DA5E7/t51.2885-15/e35/65299103_1311635815653157_2327849967097218496_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-cdg2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101,Seoul,Parks & Gardens

Seoullo 7017,"Introduction
In the 1970s, an elevated road was built to connect the eastern and western sides around Seoul Station. However, the road was closed to road traffic due to safety issues. After this, rather than tearing down the existing structure, the road was transformed into Seoullo 7017, a new pedestrian walking experience.

Seoullo 7017 gets its name from its years of new life, from being a traffic road in the 70s to a sky garden in 2017. The ""17"" also has a deeper meaning, with Seoullo 7017 being divided into 17 unique sections, and the road being located 17 meters above the ground.

There are a variety of facilities along Seoullo 7017, including an information center, cafes, gardens, and stages. Seoullo 7017 itself is open all day, every day for visitors to enjoy at their leisure. If you would like a guided tour, be sure to sign up for the guided walking tour through the official Visit Seoul website.","432 Cheongpa-ro, Hoehyeon-dong, Jung-gu, Seoul, South Korea",https://scontent-cdg2-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/130637e6699b679cb969477c3a37d79d/5E06D7E2/t51.2885-15/e35/60159624_136427844099906_3007729801221312849_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-cdg2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=106,Seoul,Parks & Gardens
Seolleung & Jeongneung Royal Tomb,"Introduction
* Night-time viewing is restricted to lighted areas
* Night-time viewing prohibited November-February for the safety of all visitors

Seonjeongneung is comprised of Seolleung Royal Tomb and Jeongneung Royal Tomb. Located in downtown Seoul, this place offers tranquil and pleasant promenades for couples and office workers. Seonjeongneung houses the burial mounds of King Seongjong (1469-1494), his wife Queen Jeonghyeon, and King Jungjong (1506-1544) of the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910).

Upon entering the grounds, you can see a red gate (the red colour denotes holiness) with a taegeuk (yin-yang) symbol. The stone paths leading to the sacrificial building are noteworthy because there are two stone paths—the elevated path is for the dead King and the lower one is for living people.

In the past, memorial rites were performed in the sacrificial building. Small sculptures on the eaves called Japsang were carved in the shape of animals, such as monkeys, and were believed to exorcise evil spirits. Next to the sacrificial building, there is a pavilion and a tombstone for the tomb of the king. Sculptures of sheep and tigers surround the tomb and are guardians of the deceased king. There is also a statue of a military officer bearing a sword. In front of the tomb is an outstanding sight called 'Mangjuseok,' which is a pair of stones designed to guide the spirit of the king to his tomb. Unlike the tombs of the kings, the queen’s tomb, Wanghureung, is simple. It doesn’t have any pavilions or sacrificial buildings, and is surrounded only by stone sculptures as guardians.

Seonjeongneung has a lush forest, and benches on the promenade provide an ideal place to relax. There are numerous small hills with clusters of trees that create a border between the mystery and serenity of the royal tombs and the hustle and bustle of downtown Seoul.","1 Seolleung-ro 100-gil, Samseong-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, South Korea",https://scontent-cdg2-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/1713e34f5de183e377667458e4fd0fac/5DFBE670/t51.2885-15/e35/s1080x1080/67371797_100895521258149_488075370176391672_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-cdg2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109,Seoul,Landmarks
Seoul World Cup Stadium,"Introduction

The shape of the stadium represents flight towards victory, and it combines the hopes of the World Cup games and spirit and traditional culture of the Korean people.
The very first impression the stadium gives is that it is very large. It provides over 60,000 seats, and in fact, in terms of area and facility, it is the best in Asia.

Naksan Park,"Introduction
Naksan Park gets its name from its camel hump-like appearance. In Korean ‘nakta’ means camel and ‘san’ means mountain. So people refer to the park as Nakta Park or Naksan Park. The mountain is a solid granite bedrock. The Joseon royal family enjoyed the natural beauty of the granite mountain, but during the Japanese Colonial Period, a hasty manner of urban planning resulted in the demolition of most parts of the mountain. In an effort to save the remaining green belts, Naksan was designated as a park on June 10, 2002. Located in the center of the Seoul, this historical and beautiful park allows its visitors to view the magnificence of the entire city.","41 Naksan-gil, Ihwa-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul, South Korea",https://scontent-cdg2-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/240fe7be2e7a50aff9c4a1ae908881b8/5E078F9A/t51.2885-15/e35/37374632_481513638980452_3604631872459505664_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-cdg2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104,Seoul,Landmarks

Gwanghwamun Gate,"Introduction
Built in 1395 under the reign of King Taejo, the first king of the Joseon Dynasty, Gwanghwamun Gate is the southern gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace. It is also the main gate of the palace, therefore larger and fancier in comparison to the other gates. Gwanghwamun Gate consists of three arched gates; the center gate was used by the king, while the other two were used by the crown prince and royal officials. The tall granite walls of the gate serve as a platform for the wooden gate tower that watches over the city. The gate has a sign with its name written at the top center of the gate tower.

Gwanghwamun Gate went through several damages and restorations over the course of history. It was first severely damaged during the Imjin War (1592-1598) and was not restored until the reconstruction of Gyeongbokgung Palace in 1864. Under the Japanese administration, the gate was demolished and relocated to the north of the palace's eastern gate, followed by series of damages during the Korean War (1950-1953). In 1968, Gwanghwamun Gate was relocated back to the south of the palace and was rebuilt using concrete; however, the gate’s position was shifted a few meters away from its original location. In 2006, a major reconstruction project took place to restore Gwanghwamun Gate to its original state and location, disassembling the structure completely and replacing concrete with granite and wood. After three years and eight months of construction, Gwanghwamun Gate was fully restored to its original form and was open to the public on August 15, 2010.","161 Sajik-ro, Jongno 1(il).2(i).3(sam).4(sa), Jongno-gu, Seoul, South Korea",https://scontent-cdg2-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/399d1b80d53b8794eb8994694a9cc22c/5E3D8598/t51.2885-15/e35/66416304_849459365440959_8074423135365927460_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-cdg2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103,Seoul,Landmarks
Gyeongbokgung Palace,"Introduction
Built in 1395, Gyeongbokgung Palace is also commonly referred to as the Northern Palace because its location is furthest north when compared to the neighboring palaces of Changdeokgung (Eastern Palace) and Gyeonghuigung (Western Palace) Palace. Gyeongbokgung Palace is arguably the most beautiful, and remains the largest of all five palaces.

The premises were once destroyed by fire during the Imjin War (Japanese Invasions, 1592-1598). However, all of the palace buildings were later restored under the leadership of Heungseondaewongun during the reign of King Gojong (1852-1919).

World Cup Park,"Introduction
Opened on May 1st, 2002, the Wolrd Cup Park was once a 15-year-old landfill that held over 92 million tons of garbage. The park is located near Seoul World Cup Stadium, and is made up of five smaller parks - Pyeonghwa (Peace) Park, Haneul (Sky) Park, Noeul (Sunset) Park, Nanjicheon Park, and Nanji Hangang Park.

* Pyeonghwa Park: Closest to Seoul World Cup Stadium, it holds a pond, garden, children’s playground, and forest. As a representative park of World Cup Park, the park was designed in hopes of peace and harmony between mankind and nature. It is often used as a picnic area and place for nature studies.

* Nanji Hangang Park: Nanji Hangang Park was developed on the banks of the Hangang River. In contrast to other Hangang River parks, Nanji Hangang Park is a water-friendly park that has a gradual slope towards the riverbank. The park consists of a camping ground, soccer field, basketball court, grass field, cruise ship port, and an area for nature studies.

* Haneul Park: Haneul Park consists of vast grassland located at the highest elevation of the five parks. The park's pasture is covered with eulalias and wild flowers in their most natural state. In addition, 30,000 butterflies of different species were introduced in 2000 to stabilize the ecosystem. Five wind-powered generators provide power to the park and the park’s maintenance office. Once a mountain of garbage, it is now a green hill with 22 lookout points offering breathtaking views of Seoul, including the N Seoul Tower, Bukhansan Mountain, and Hangang River. Tall trees are line the park to provide shades and serve as resting spots for visitors. As a popular spot to enjoy the sight of eulalias, the park usually remains open until late in the evening during the Eulalia Festival period.

* Noeul Park: In order to prevent the vast area of land of what was once a wasteland from becoming an unnecessary chunk of land, a nine-hole golf course was constructed in what is now known as Noeul Park. The golf course serves as an environment friendly entertainment park to visitors while stabilizing the geographical formation and has an urban park nearby that offers scenic views of the Hangang River and beautiful sunset. Located west of the golf park is Noeul Square, decorated with shrubs and flowers.

* Nanjicheon Park: Nanjicheon Park was developed from the Nanji Stream, which flowed under Haneul Park. It was once overflowing with sewage runoff from a nearby landfill, but it has since been beautifully restored into a park with clear water. The park is built to serve as a recreational spot for those with for youths, elders, and people with disabilities.","Mapo-gu, Seoul, South Korea",https://scontent-cdg2-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/415d82a37e5bcc2ae6012331ff7c2b07/5E0BEC02/t51.2885-15/e35/47184994_683827098685317_5864347489064067493_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-cdg2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109,Seoul,Parks & Gardens

Dongdaemun Gate (Heunginjimun),"Introduction
Heunginjimun Gate was built to protect Hanseongbu, which historically housed important government facilities. Heunginjimun Gate was the gate on the east side of the outer wall of Seoul Fortress among eight gates. It is referred to as Dongdaemun Gate as well. The gate was constructed during King Taejo’s 5th year in 1396, remodeled during the reign of King Danjong in 1453 and was newly built in 1869 during the sixth year of King Gojong’s reign in 1869.

The gate features a hipped roof which has five front compartments and two side compartments on a two-storied building. The thin and weak bracket system supports the eaves and is excessively decorated, reflecting the construction features of the late Joseon period. Also, outside of the fortress is the half-circle shaped Ongseong, a small wall, to protect the gate.

Deoksugung Palace,"Introduction
Located at the corner of Seoul's busiest downtown intersection, Deoksugung Palace is famous for its elegant stone-wall road. It is also the only palace that sits alongside a series of western style buildings that add to the uniqueness of the surrounding scenery. Deoksugung Palace originally belonged to Wolsandaegun (1454-1488), the older brother of King Seongjong (1469-1494) of the Joseon Dynasty. It became a proper palace when Gwanghaegun (1575-1641) ascended to the throne and gave this royal residence the name Gyeongungung Palace in 1611. Over the following decades, the palace alternated between being an official palace and a temporary residence. The name did not official change to Deoksugung Palace, meaning the “palace of virtuous longevity,” until 1907. While the palace incompassed a vast area with many buildings, the current palace grounds are just a small shadow of the prior splendor, with very few structures remaining.

Upon entering Deoksugung Palace through Daehanmun Gate, visitors will cross the wide bridge of Geumcheon Stream. The king's carriage would pass over this bridge during ancient times. The legal building Junghwajeon Hall is very stately, revealing its long history. The Jeukjodang Building received its name from Gwanghaegun and In-Jo, who both ascended to the throne here. The front sign on Jeukjodang was written personally by Gojong (26th king of the Joseon Dynasty, r. 1863-1907) in 1905 after he became king. Hamnyeongjeon Hall was where Gojong slept, named with the meaning of wishing for lasting peace for Gojong. The East Wing served as the king’s room, and the west wing was for the queen.

Jeonggwanheon Hall was the first Western-style building built in the palace, completed in 1900. Gojong enjoyed drinking coffee and spending his free time here. The back of the building had secret passageways to the Russian Emissary, which still exist today. Seokjojeon Hall is the other Western-style building that still remains in Deoksugung Palace, and it was in the process of being built by a British man for his company, when in 1905 the property rights were transferred to Japan. It was finally completed in 1910. After Gojong’s death, Seokjojeon Hall became a Japanese art gallery open to the public. After the Korean Declaration of Independence, the American-Russian joint commission was held here as well in May 1946. The east wing of Seokjogwan Hall now serves as a palace treasure exhibition, and the west wing is used as part of the National Modern Art Center.

Junghwajeon Hall was the center of politics during the Korean Empire and served as the backdrop to critical discussions on national affairs among the country’s leaders. The elaborateness of the hall’s interior is said to reflect the confidence of King Gojong in his ability to effectively lead the country into the 20th century. One of the most striking parts of the building is the pair of dragons that decorates the canopy above the throne of the king. These dragons can also be seen on the ceiling of Junghwajeon Hall and were representative designs of Deoksugung Palace, the imperial palace at that time. Though Junghwajeon Hall was originally built in 1902 as a multi-roofed building, it was redesigned as a single-roofed building in 1906 after it caught on fire two years before that.","99 Sejong-daero, Jeong-dong, Jung-gu, Seoul, South Korea",https://scontent-cdg2-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/ba09166bdc367bda207a07215f7b90eb/5E09675E/t51.2885-15/e35/55899991_2492363154107716_4048448991549858595_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-cdg2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104,Seoul,Landmarks
Namsan Park,"Introduction
Mt. Namsan is a symbolic mountain located at the center of Seoul. Although not as high as other surrounding mountains, Mt. Namsan is a very popular nonetheless as a resting site. At the top, there are various facilities such as Palgakjeong (octagonal hall), Seoul Tower, Maritime Aquarium, fountains, and Namsan Library. You may take a cable car to the top or walk up the stairway path. Other than this path, there are many other walkways to Namdaemun, Hoehyun-dong, Taegyero 3(sam)-ga, Jangchung Park, Itaewon, Huam-dong and much more. The driving courses here are also popular for couples.
Namsan Park is a historical site. You will find Bonghwadae (beacon mound) at the top as it was once the center of capital defense. During the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) the capital was changed to Hanyang,(current Seoul) and to protect the city from invasions, castle walls were built on the 4 major mountains like Mt. Bukaksan, Mt. Inwangsan, Mt. Naksan and Mt. Namsan. On Namsan peak, five beacons were built to report the news from local governments to the central government with a five-signal system.
Also on the top of Mt. Namsan, there is the Palgakjeong Pavilion, which has a fantastic view. At Seoul Tower (479.7m), you can view the whole landscape of Seoul and the West Sea beyond Incheon. The rotating restaurant in the Seoul Tower also boasts excellent views. With excellent night view, you should try having dinner at the tower. It would be a great experience to visit Namsangol Traditional Korean Village which is a village of 5 traditional Korean houses.","100-177 Hoehyeondong 1(il)-ga, Jung-gu, Seoul, South Korea",https://scontent-cdg2-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/bac6fc4a505935e242ebb7efcf813c34/5E0BE2E9/t51.2885-15/e35/51757361_595370160982173_8907242463503582908_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-cdg2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109,Seoul,Parks & Gardens
King Sejong Statue,"Introduction
The King Sejong Statue was erected at the center of Gwanghawmun Square on Hangeul Day (October 9) of 2009. Sitting with a gentle smile on his face and a book in his hand, the bronze statue of 9.5m in height celebrates the King and his great achievements.

In front of the statue lie a celestial globe, a rain gauge, and a sundial, all of which King Sejong invented himself during his reign. Behind the statue, there are six columns with golden carvings depicting the King's major accomplishments, as well as an underground passage to the 'Sejong's Story' exhibition hall. Surrounding the statue, on the edges of the Square, is the 'Waterway of History,' a stream flowing on tiles with inscriptions of Korean history.

King Sejong (1392-1910)
King Sejong is best remembered as the inventor of Hangeul, the Korean alphabet. During his reign, he consolidated the basis for ruling the Joseon Dynasty by incorporating Confucian philosophy of politics. Furthermore, he led the nation's great strides in agriculture, literature, science and technology.","175 Sejong-daero, Jongno 1(il).2(i).3(sam).4(sa), Jongno-gu, Seoul, South Korea",https://scontent-cdg2-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/bf175db3a621de5bac46637bbabc1b1d/5E34A001/t51.2885-15/e35/65034104_144757720033825_8664658561176296085_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-cdg2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=101,Seoul,Historic sites
Inwangsan Mountain,"Introduction
The ancient fortress walls of Seoul that connect the ritual grounds of King Taejo and Muhakdaesa to the Sajik Tunnel and Jahamun Gate still remain on the grounds of Inwangsan Mountain. Many people enjoy hiking from the path that begins at the Sajik Tunnel, which leads to the peak of the mountain passing the fortress walls, then hike back down to Buam-dong. The hiking course is also connected to the road in front of Cheongwadae so hikers can also walk along the historical Palpan-ro road, Hyoja-ro road, and Gyeongbokgung Palace. The hiking path located behind Sajik Park leads to Hwanghakjeong Pavilion, where archers during the Joseon Dynasty once honed their marksmanship. The Hwanghakjeong Pavilion was originally located in the Gyeongbokgung Palace but was relocated to the mountain. From the top, a panoramic view of the surrounding area spreads as far as Naksan Mountain, Namsan Mountain, and Baegaksan Mountain with Gyeongbokgung Palace at its center.

The hiking path past Sajik Park's T-intersection is a popular walking course to nearby office workers during lunch time. A view of Cheongwadae is visible from a top beombawi rock (tiger's rock). For hikers seeking to walk along the ridges, it is recommended to take the path down to Hongje-dong quarry or Jahamun Gate. Hikers are recommended to take their time to fully enjoy the view of the surroundings while walking along the path of the outer walls. The stone stairway following the path past Changuimun Gate will take hikers to the path along the outer walls. This path stretches for approximately 200m and a set of stones used to build the city walls during the reign of King Taejo, King Sejong, and King Sukjung still remain along the way. The thick, dark-colored mosses on the stones indicate the long history of Seoul.

The view of the refreshing landscape and Inwangsan Mountain's peak will greet the hikers once they walk back to the inner city walls through a step of stones. Hikers will be able to get a bird's-eye-view of Seoul's mountains and skyscrapers surrounding the Hangang River. The city walls along the path going down to Cheongun-dong still withhold their beauty from the past. The inner wall path also leads to the Tangchundaeseong Fortress. Tanchundaeseong Fortress was built in order to reinforce the capital’s defenses after the Japanese invasion in 1592 and the Manchu war of 1636.

Inwangsan Mountain stands at a height of 338.2m and spreads throughout the regions of Hongje-dong in Seodaemun-gu and Muak-dong, Nusang-dong, Ogin-dong and Buam-dong in Jongno-gu. The unique and colossal rock formations and the view of Seoul and Cheongwadae are only a few of the many charms of Inwangsan Mountain.

Ihwa Mural Village,"Like the Ant Mural Village in Hongje, the Ihwa Mural Village (이화동벽화마을) was set for destruction as it was seen as a bit of a slum and down-trodden area but in 2006 under the “Art in City Project” carried out by The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, murals were added in an effort to revitalize the neighborhood in Seoul. The revitalization has come at a cost though. Beautiful murals in varying sizes placed on walls, fences and rooftops were created by 70 artists and certainly brought loads of tourists to the area, however, no one really asked the residents, mostly elderly Korean citizens, if they were okay with this or explained what the murals might bring. This is a similar story with what is going on in the Bukchon Hanok Village one of the MOST visited neighborhoods in the city of Seoul and the residents aren’t all that happy with the influx.","Ihwa-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul, South Korea",https://scontent-cdg2-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/c2118dbeef6bf9edf0813cb9bd623fe1/5E0E96E8/t51.2885-15/e35/p1080x1080/61859266_173064543710823_1000636071058119054_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-cdg2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103,Seoul,Landmarks

National Palace Museum of Korea,"Introduction
The National Palace Museum of Korea opened in 1992 displaying relics from the Joseon Dynasty [1392~1910]. Over 20,000 royal relics from Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeokgung Palace, Changgyeonggung Palace and Jongmyo Shrine are on display.

1. Royal Symbols and Records
The Joseon Dynasty attained Confucian ideals, and therefore, the king and his queen were worshipped as parents of all citizens. To elevate their authority, the Joseon royal households crafted various royal symbols.
2. Ancestral Rites
The royal ancestral rite was held at a royal shrine encompassing the ancestral tablets of the late kings and queens of the Joseon Dynasty. This was not merely a royal ancestral worshipping ceremony, but also a festival with music and dance, in the hope for the nation's eternal prosperity.
3. Palace Architecture
The palace was the living quarters of the king and his family as well as the center of administration where the king ruled the nation. The center of the palace in the Joseon Dynasty, according to traditional Oriental architectural planning, was featured at Jeongjeon. The main hall was the center of state events and political discussions, and the Pyeonjeon, the government office.
4. Joseon Sciences
The Joseon Dynasty strove to establish the legitimacy of its foundation to enrich the nation's economy. To attain these ideals, the dynasty unprecedentedly promoted such areas as the sciences and medicine while developing various weapons for national defence.
5. Royal Life
The king and queen were symbolic figures of the Joseon Dynasty, but they were also ordinary people who lived private lives within the palace. The palace was divided into various sections of living space such as the king's office, the queen's quarters, and the prince's study room. Each section contained appropriate pieces of furniture, which were made of the finest quality materials according to well-established criteria for the royal family.","12 Hyoja-ro, Jongno 1(il).2(i).3(sam).4(sa), Jongno-gu, Seoul, South Korea",https://scontent-cdg2-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/ddaabc15d6a69ce10644ac9a4ad4c439/5E0E18BF/t51.2885-15/e35/68972031_185685302467567_3856479384892773765_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-cdg2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=107,Seoul,Landmarks

Changdeokgung Palace,"Introduction
Changdeokgung Palace was the second royal villa built following the construction of Gyeongbukgung Palace in 1405. It was the principal palace for many kings of the Joseon Dynasty, and is the most well-preserved of the five remaining royal Joseon palaces. The palace grounds are comprised of a public palace area, a royal family residence building, and the rear garden. Known as a place of rest for the kings, the rear garden boasts a gigantic tree that is over 300 years old, a small pond and a pavilion.

The palace gained importance starting from the time of Seongjong, the 9th king of Joseon, when a number of kings began using it as a place of residence. Unfortunately, the palace was burned down by angry citizens in 1592 when the royal family fled their abode during the Japanese invasion of Korea. Thanks to Gwanghaegun, the palace was restored in 1611. Even today, it houses a number of cultural treasures, such as Injeongjeon Hall, Daejojeon Hall, Seonjeongjeon Hall, and Nakseonjae.

Changdeokgung Palace’s rear garden was constructed during the reign of King Taejong and served as a resting place for the royal family members. The garden had formerly been called Bukwon and Geumwon, but was renamed Biwon after King Kojong came into power. The garden was kept as natural as possible and was touched by human hands only when absolutely necessary. Buyongjeong, Buyongji, Juhabru, Eosumun, Yeonghwadang, Bullomun, Aeryeonjeong, and Yeongyeongdang are some of the many pavilions and fountains that occupy the garden. The most beautiful time to see the garden is during the fall when the autumn foliage is at its peak and the leaves have just started to fall.

Though it has been treasured by Koreans for centuries, Changdeokgung Palace was recognized as a World Cultural Heritage site by the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Committee in December of 1997 during the committee meeting in Naples, Italy.

Changdeokgung Palace was one of the places visited by the first ladies of the Seoul G20 summit during the G20 conference in Seoul in November 2010. It is one of the most historically significant attractions that represent the beauty of Korea.","99 Yulgok-ro, Waryong-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul, South Korea",https://scontent-prg1-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/0d3aca77c0e3af2a64e7efb7eca8fa5d/5DF5DDD2/t51.2885-15/e35/61663883_622492918262504_1685832559681507677_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-prg1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=108,Seoul,Landmarks
