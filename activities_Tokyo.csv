Edo-Tokyo Museum,2,"The Tokyo Metropolitan Edo-Tokyo Museum opened its doors in March 1993 as a space to reflect on the history and culture of Edo-Tokyo and envision the city and life of the future. Housed in a unique building modeled after an elevated-floor type warehouse, the museum has been a landmark and popular tourist attraction in Tokyo since its opening. The permanent exhibition, showcasing original objects and replicas, offers visitors a journey through the 400-year history of Edo-Tokyo since Tokugawa Ieyasu entered Edo. In addition to the permanent exhibition, the museum holds special exhibitions at the first floor gallery five to six times a year and carries out various other events, including lectures and workshops on the history and culture of Edo-Tokyo. We hope that the museum can be Tokyo’s center for the creation of new culture and a place of respite for visitors.","1-4-1 Yokoami, Sumida 130-0015, Tokyo Prefecture",https://scontent-cdg2-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/e35/s1080x1080/70176052_495649164557351_3819780280377706128_n.jpg?_nc_ht=scontent-cdg2-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=111&oh=f513a51dc31ed35d539a8c94cd405d5f&oe=5E7D3C28
